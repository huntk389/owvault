[2025-05-12 19:27:25 UTC] User: How many lbs of teres major do I need for 25 8 ounce orders, I also will have to trim the silver skin so keep that in mind
[2025-05-12 19:27:25 UTC] Assistant: Great question—**teres major** has a notable amount of silver skin and some light trimming waste. Here’s how to break it down:

### **Order Details**
- You need: **25 orders**
- Each order: **8 oz cooked portion**
- Total cooked weight needed: **25 × 8 oz = 200 oz = 12.5 lbs cooked**

---

### **Teres Major Yield Estimate (Raw to Trimmed/Cooked)**
- **Raw yield after trimming** (removal of silver skin and small fat cap): approx. **85%**
- **Cooking shrinkage** (grill, roast, or pan sear): approx. **80–85% yield** depending on method and temp

**So overall: final yield from raw to plated is ~70%**

---

### **How Much to Buy**

To get **12.5 lbs cooked**, with a 70% total yield:

\[
\text{Required raw weight} = \frac{12.5\ \text{lbs}}{0.70} \approx 17.9\ \text{lbs}
\]

### **Final Answer:**
You’ll need to purchase **about 18 lbs** of **raw teres major** to safely serve **25 trimmed and cooked 8 oz portions**.

Let me know your prep method if you want an even tighter estimate!
[2025-05-12 19:28:06 UTC] User: I weigh each portion before it’s cooked
[2025-05-12 19:28:06 UTC] Assistant: Perfect—since you're portioning **8 oz raw per order**, we don’t need to account for **cooking shrinkage** in your purchasing estimate. We’ll just factor in **trim loss** from the silver skin and any fat.

### **Teres Major Trim Yield (Raw to Usable Raw)**
- Average yield **after trimming**: **85–90%**, depending on butcher precision  
- Let’s use **85%** to be safe

---

### **Math:**
You need **25 × 8 oz = 200 oz = 12.5 lbs of usable raw portions**

\[
\text{Raw needed} = \frac{12.5\ \text{lbs}}{0.85} \approx 14.7\ \text{lbs}
\]

---

### **Final Answer:**
You’ll need to purchase **approximately 15 lbs of raw teres major** to get **25 trimmed 8 oz raw portions**.

Want help adding this to a prep or ordering sheet?
[2025-05-12 19:28:54 UTC] User: Awesome I just need to pull ot
[2025-05-12 19:28:54 UTC] Assistant: Got it—just pull **15 lbs of raw teres major** from your inventory to prep for those **25 trimmed 8 oz raw portions**.

Let me know if you want a quick label or prep sheet for your team to go with it!
[2025-06-28 23:42:07 UTC] User: Look at Solyn’s Directive
