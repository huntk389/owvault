[2025-06-20 17:13:03 UTC] User: Solyn I have to email a manager from a sister property Matt Fellers- His employee Thomas Munos applied for kitchen supervisor and we would like to respectfully offer him the position. I want it to be a kind request, because Thomas has worked for me before and we really like him. He said his girlfriend had applied and got the job here and thatâ€™s why he wants to move back to Montana.

**Subject:** Offer of Kitchen Supervisor Position â€“ Thomas Munos

Hi Matt,

I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to reach out regarding Thomas Munos, who recently applied for the Kitchen Supervisor position with us here at The Branch. Thomas has worked with me before, and weâ€™ve always appreciated his strong work ethic, great attitude, and leadership potential.

After reviewing his application and speaking with him, weâ€™d love to extend an offer for the position. He mentioned that his girlfriend was recently hired here, and heâ€™s hoping to relocate back to Montana to be closer to her.

I wanted to touch base with you directly out of respect, since heâ€™s currently part of your team. Please let me know your thoughts, and if thereâ€™s anything youâ€™d like to discuss regarding timing or transition. Weâ€™re happy to work with you to ensure itâ€™s as smooth as possible.

Thanks so much,  
Kayla Hunt  
Kitchen Manager â€“ The Branch  
West Yellowstone, MT
