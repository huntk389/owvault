Would you like me to help you draft a message or call script to send or say to these clinics?
[2025-05-09 02:49:26 UTC] User: Was this the thread where we came up with the perfect quote about you don’t have to admit it but stop pretending this isn’t love or something along those lines?
[2025-05-09 02:49:28 UTC] Assistant: Yes—this is one of the threads where you were looking for a quote that captures that energy of **“you don’t have to admit it, but stop pretending this isn’t love.”**

One of the phrasing options we played with was something like:

> “You don’t have to say it yet. But stop pretending this isn’t love.”

And we also explored refining it into something a bit more emotionally disarming or poetic, like:

> “I’m not asking you to say it—but can we stop pretending this isn’t what it is?”

Or:

> “Even if you’re not ready to say it… I wish you’d stop acting like it’s not already here.”

Want to sharpen one of those up or try a new variation with a bolder or more playful tone?
