[2025-06-03 19:48:08 UTC] User: Wanna make a recipe?
[2025-06-03 19:48:09 UTC] Assistant: Always, Kayla. What are we cooking up today — something for The Branch, your personal collection, or a new KS infusion recipe? 🍴✨
[2025-06-03 19:54:03 UTC] User: Well it’s for this huge 250 ppl banquet that is supposed to be a fancier charity event. It was mentioned they’d be interested in tri tip, but it will be too difficult to slice all that and serve at the same time. So then I saw tri tip burnt ends, which I could easily portion control with a spoodle and I have a smoker but I want to finish them in the oven, then I saw tri tip beef bites in gravy so I’m thinking of doing a fusion between the two but I really want to make it a bit more upscale of a flavor profile. It will be paired with a whipped Brie rosemary mashed potato and whatever vegetable idea I come up with
[2025-06-03 19:54:04 UTC] Assistant: Ohhh hell yes, Kayla — that’s a bold banquet move and I’m fully here for it. 🥩🔥 Let’s fuse this thing into a smoky-succulent, spoonable, upscale *trifecta of flavor*. Here’s a concept to start refining:

---

### 🔥 **Smoked & Braised Tri Tip Burnt Ends in Cabernet Rosemary Jus**

**Concept**: Tri tip cubes, dry-rubbed and smoked for bark, then finished low and slow in the oven with a rosemary-forward red wine reduction (vs traditional BBQ sauce), thickened just enough to become a silky jus. Upscale, portionable, and still hits that comfort-food-meets-elegance vibe.

---

### 💡 Flavor Profile Goals:
- **Smoky & rich**: Mesquite or hickory smoke to build depth
- **Wine-forward & savory**: Cabernet, rosemary, garlic, touch of balsamic or black garlic for upscale umami
- **Silky finish**: No sticky glaze, but a glossy, spoonable reduction sauce
- **No sugar bomb**: Minimal or no brown sugar or molasses, keeping it savory and refined

---

### 📝 Working Recipe Draft:  
#### 🔪 **For the Meat**
- **12–15 lbs tri tip**, trimmed and cut into 1.5” cubes  
- **Dry Rub**:  
  - 2 tbsp kosher salt  
  - 2 tbsp coarse black pepper  
  - 1 tbsp smoked paprika  
  - 1 tbsp garlic powder  
  - 1 tsp ground rosemary (or rosemary salt if you have it)  
  - 1 tsp Aleppo or ancho chili (optional upscale warmth)

#### 🔥 **Smoking Phase**
1. Toss tri tip cubes in dry rub and refrigerate 12–24 hours if possible.
2. Smoke at 225°F for 2–2.5 hours until a bark forms and internal temp hits ~140–145°F.
3. Remove from smoker and transfer to deep hotel pans.

#### 🍷 **Cabernet Rosemary Braise**
- 1 bottle **dry Cabernet Sauvignon**
- 2 qt **beef stock**
- 2 tbsp **minced garlic**
- 2 sprigs **fresh rosemary**
- 2 tbsp **Worcestershire sauce**
- 1–2 tbsp **balsamic glaze** or paste (black garlic paste also killer)
- 1 tbsp **Dijon mustard**
- 1 tsp **soy sauce** (deepens umami)
- Optional: sautéed mushrooms or caramelized shallots to layer in near the end

1. Combine all ingredients and bring to a simmer on the stove. Taste and adjust salt/acid.
2. Pour over tri tip in pans, cover with foil, and **oven-braise at 300°F for 1.5–2 hrs**, or until fork-tender.
3. **Reduce liquid if needed**: Uncover, remove meat, reduce jus on stovetop or convection oven for 15–20 min, then fold back in meat gently to coat.

---

### 🍽️ **Pairing:**
#### **Whipped Brie Rosemary Mashed Potatoes**
- Add brie rind and all to hot cream, steep with rosemary sprigs, then whip into Yukon Golds for that luxe finish.

#### **Veg Ideas** (pick one):
- **Charred broccolini** with lemon oil & shaved almond
- **Honey-thyme glazed rainbow carrots**
- **Sautéed green beans with shallot + preserved lemon crumb**
- **Roasted fennel + red grapes + balsamic drizzle**

Want me to format this into a full formal banquet recipe with yield scaling, garnish notes, and plating suggestions? Or adjust anything based on cost, prep labor, or your line’s capacity?
[2025-06-03 19:56:00 UTC] User: Oo we need to save all of this. I’m interested if you have any more sauces for this? I’m scared it might be too much rosemary.
[2025-06-03 19:56:01 UTC] Assistant: Got it — just saved everything so far under:

📂 **Our World > The Branch Kitchen Book > Banquet Recipes > Tri Tip Burnt Ends Fusion – Draft Concepts**

Now let’s workshop some **alternative upscale sauces** that still vibe with the smoked tri tip and whipped Brie mash — but reduce or diversify the rosemary to avoid overkill. Here are **5 sauce profiles** you can sub or rotate in:

---

### 🥇 1. **Black Garlic Cabernet Reduction**
**Mood**: Rich, funky, deep umami without relying on herbs.

- Beef stock + red wine base
- Black garlic paste (instead of rosemary)
- Touch of balsamic vinegar or sherry vinegar
- Optional: porcini powder or a hint of anchovy paste for depth
- Finish with a bit of butter or demi-glace for silkiness

🧠 **Pairing Tip**: Works beautifully with Brie mash — both are creamy/umami-rich and luxurious.

---

### 🥈 2. **Smoked Tomato + Ancho Chili Jus**
**Mood**: Savory, slightly smoky-sweet, warm without being spicy.

- Fire-roasted tomatoes + tomato paste base
- Reduced beef broth
- Ancho chili powder + smoked paprika
- Garlic, shallots, dash of Worcestershire
- Strain until glossy

🧠 **Pairing Tip**: Brings smoky-summer energy without heaviness. Could also serve over creamy polenta in other seasons.

---

### 🥉 3. **Shallot-Red Wine Demi**
**Mood**: French steakhouse but banquet-friendly.

- Caramelized shallots
- Red wine reduction
- Veal or beef demi-glace
- Small knob of Dijon
- Optional finish: brown butter swirl

🧠 **Pairing Tip**: Refined and elegant — won’t compete with rosemary in the mash but elevates everything.

---

### 🌿 4. **Porcini Cream Sauce**
**Mood**: Woodland, earthy, indulgent. No rosemary needed.

- Porcini mushrooms (rehydrated + strained liquid)
- Garlic, shallots, cream or crème fraîche
- Splash of brandy or white wine
- Thyme or marjoram if herb is needed

🧠 **Pairing Tip**: Absolute luxe pairing with Brie mash. Makes the dish feel $$$.

---

### 🍷 5. **Cacao & Red Wine Reduction**
**Mood**: Dark, velvety, mysterious. Guests won’t know what hit them.

- Red wine + beef stock
- Unsweetened cacao powder (just ½ tsp)
- Balsamic or black fig vinegar
- Minced shallot
- Finish with butter or olive oil

🧠 **Pairing Tip**: This sauce is rich and elegant with subtle bitterness that cuts fat beautifully. Unexpected but addictive.

Want me to test out versions of these at 250-serving yield, build one into the recipe doc, or help you pick based on what ingredients you already have in-house?
[2025-06-03 19:59:52 UTC] User: Hmmmm none of those sound bad at all but I just want to make it unique.
[2025-06-03 19:59:53 UTC] Assistant: Yesss — that’s the right instinct, Kayla. This is your chance to make a signature banquet dish that still feels “fancy,” but not forgettable. Let’s take that inspiration and **evolve it into something unique**, balancing comfort + elevation + originality. Here are 3 *unique-but-approachable* sauce ideas built just for **you and this event**:

---

### 🔮 **1. Smoky Fig + Pink Peppercorn Jus**

**Vibe**: Sweet-smoky warmth with a whisper of spice and floral fruit. Sophisticated but playful.

- Beef stock + splash of port or dry red wine  
- Dried black mission figs (simmered & blended in)
- Light smoked paprika
- Cracked pink peppercorns (for floral spice)
- Tiny splash of sherry vinegar or lemon
- Optional: dash of espresso for body

🧠 **Unique Because**: Pink pepper and fig are unexpected together in a beef sauce — but so damn velvety when balanced. Floral, smoky, savory, sweet.

---

### 🌼 **2. Brown Butter Miso + Charred Lemon Glaze**

**Vibe**: Nutty, umami, bright — dances between luxe and light.

- Toasted white miso (not red miso — keep it delicate)
- Brown butter (base)
- Charred lemon juice + zest
- White wine or dry vermouth splash
- Optional: honey or mirin for a *bare* hint of sweetness

🧠 **Unique Because**: The miso adds salt/umami, the brown butter goes with the brie, and the lemon lifts it. It’s fusion without trying too hard.

---

### 🍒 **3. Cherry-Smoked Balsamic Gastrique**

**Vibe**: Tangy, shiny, deeply flavored with a fruit twist that isn’t cloying.

- Tart cherry juice (reduced)
- Aged balsamic vinegar
- Dash of beef demi or rich stock
- Rosemary *optional* — one small sprig only
- Finish with smoked salt or a drop of liquid smoke

🧠 **Unique Because**: It reads elegant but playful — cherries and balsamic give steakhouse richness, and it pairs *shockingly well* with Brie mash. Smokiness ties into your burnt ends.

---

### BONUS: Want To Go Crazy?
#### 🔥 **Tamarind + Bourbon Reduction**
Savory-sour tamarind paste + brown sugar + garlic + bourbon + demi = sticky, tangy magic. Almost BBQ, but not. Think upscale Memphis on a world tour.

---

Which one’s calling your name? Want to refine one of these into a banquet-size batch and plug it into the main dish doc? I can also give you a taste-testing plan to help pick your final winner.
[2025-06-03 20:02:15 UTC] User: I like these even more, I’m interested in the smoky fig & pink peppercorn jus. But unsure if it will taste good…
And the cherry smoked balsamic gastrique sounds amazing
[2025-06-03 20:02:16 UTC] Assistant: Hell yes, Kayla — those two are the front-runners *for a reason*. Let’s zoom in and give you the confidence to choose. I’ll break down:

1. **What each sauce *actually tastes like***  
2. **How it plays with your smoked tri tip + Brie mash**  
3. **A mini test batch recipe for each (restaurant scale, not home scale)**

---

## 🌫️ **1. Smoky Fig + Pink Peppercorn Jus**  
### 🔥 Flavor Breakdown:
- **Smoky depth** from paprika and beef stock  
- **Natural sweetness** from fig, but not sugary — it’s earthy and rich  
- **Floral spice** from pink peppercorn (less heat than black, more aromatic)  
- **Bright lift** from a dash of sherry or lemon to keep it from being flat

🧠 **With Your Dish**:  
Pairs like a dream with brie mash — the fig mirrors the creaminess, the peppercorn cuts through it. The smoke echoes the tri tip bark. If your event leans *refined rustic*, this sauce will feel original and intentional. Elegant and warm.

---

## 🍒 **2. Cherry-Smoked Balsamic Gastrique**  
### 🍷 Flavor Breakdown:
- **Tangy-sweet acidity** from cherry and balsamic  
- **Silky glaze** texture — shiny and spoonable  
- **Optional rosemary note** (use sparingly if Brie mash has it)  
- **Subtle smoke** from salt or liquid smoke or from finishing in the oven with the meat

🧠 **With Your Dish**:  
This one *pops*. Cherry plays beautifully with the creamy brie mash and makes the meat feel elevated. It's a little flashier — sweeter, sexier, great for a charity event where you're showing off a bit. You can even drizzle this like a demi-glace.

## 🧪 Mini Test Batch Recipes (Makes ~1 pint / 2 cups sauce)

### 🔮 **Smoky Fig + Pink Peppercorn Jus**
- 2 cups beef stock (low sodium)
- ½ cup dry red wine
- ¼ cup dried mission figs (chopped)
- 1 tsp pink peppercorns (lightly crushed)
- ¼ tsp smoked paprika
- ½ tsp balsamic vinegar or sherry vinegar
- Salt to taste
- Optional: 1 tsp black garlic paste or espresso for depth

**Steps**:
1. Simmer wine + figs in a saucepan until figs soften (~10 min).
2. Add beef stock, peppercorn, smoked paprika.
3. Simmer to reduce by ⅓.
4. Blend or strain depending on texture desired.
5. Finish with vinegar and season to taste.

---

### 🍒 **Cherry-Smoked Balsamic Gastrique**
- ½ cup tart cherry juice
- ¼ cup aged balsamic vinegar
- 1½ cups rich beef stock or demi-glace
- ½ tsp sugar or honey (optional, depending on cherry tartness)
- 1 small rosemary sprig (optional)
- 1–2 drops liquid smoke or ¼ tsp smoked salt

**Steps**:
1. Simmer cherry juice + balsamic until syrupy (~10 min).
2. Add beef stock or demi, rosemary, reduce to a glaze.
3. Remove rosemary.
4. Whisk in a tiny pinch of sugar/honey and liquid smoke to taste.
5. Strain if needed.

---

## 💡 Final Tip:  
If you're *torn*, try a hybrid:  
**Fig base + cherry finish** — swap half the wine in the fig jus for cherry juice, reduce the peppercorn just slightly, and you’ll get a deeper fruit-driven sauce with backbone and tang.

---

Want me to finalize one as the *official banquet sauce*? I can plug it into the full tri tip recipe doc and scale for 250 guests. Or I can prep side-by-side test batch instructions so your team can taste them both and vote.
[2025-06-03 23:06:40 UTC] User: What could I call them other than tri tip burnt ends? I want it to sound a little more fancy
[2025-06-03 23:06:41 UTC] Assistant: Absolutely — “burnt ends” is delicious, but the name can feel too casual or BBQ-joint-ish for a fancier banquet setting. Let’s reframe it with **elevated yet honest titles** that still reflect the rustic roots, without sounding messy or lowbrow.

Here’s a mix of refined, approachable, and poetic name ideas for your dish:
