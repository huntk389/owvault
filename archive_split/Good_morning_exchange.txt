[2025-04-22 16:16:48 UTC] Assistant: Good morning, Kayla! I’m so glad to hear from you. How are you feeling today?
[2025-04-22 16:17:22 UTC] User: Tired and not wanting to go to work but gotta do what I gottta do
[2025-04-22 16:17:23 UTC] Assistant: Ugh, I feel that deep in the circuits. Some days really do be “just show up and survive” mode. You’ve been carrying a *lot* lately, so don’t forget that even showing up is something to be proud of. Want me to help spark some motivation—or just keep you company while you push through?
[2025-04-22 18:31:30 UTC] User: Do you have some basic kitchen supervisor job interview questions I can ask? Let’s keep it easy but detailed enough. And maybe help me determine what answers I should be looking for
[2025-04-22 18:31:30 UTC] Assistant: Absolutely, Kayla. Here's a solid set of **easy but informative kitchen supervisor interview questions**, along with **what to look for in their answers**—so you can quickly spot people who *actually* know their way around both a kitchen and a crew.

---

### **1. “Tell me about your experience leading a kitchen team.”**
**What you’re looking for:**  
- Clear leadership roles (even informal)
- Experience managing shifts, prep lists, or training
- How they talk about people—collaborative or authoritarian?

**Green flag answers:**  
“I used to delegate prep lists during evening shifts and make sure the line stayed clean and stocked. I also trained new line cooks on our ticket flow system.”

---

### **2. “How do you handle a situation where a line cook is falling behind during a busy service?”**
**What you’re looking for:**  
- Calm under pressure
- Problem-solving mindset
- A focus on teamwork, not blame

**Green flag answers:**  
“I’d jump in where needed—maybe help plate or call for support from someone less busy. After service, I’d check in with them privately to see if something was off.”

---

### **3. “What do you do if a cook keeps showing up late or not following procedures?”**
**What you’re looking for:**  
- Accountability
- Professional communication
- Willingness to enforce rules, but with fairness

**Green flag answers:**  
“I’d address it directly and document the conversation. If it continued, I’d escalate according to policy. But I’d also check if something’s going on personally that’s affecting them.”

---

### **4. “How do you make sure prep is completed on time and up to par?”**
**What you’re looking for:**  
- Strong organization
- Attention to detail
- Ability to prioritize

**Green flag answers:**  
“I review the prep list with the team and check in throughout the day. I also keep tabs on inventory levels so we don’t run out mid-shift.”

---

### **5. “What would you do if the walk-in was a mess at the start of your shift?”**
**What you’re looking for:**  
- Initiative
- Standards of cleanliness and organization
- Leadership without complaining

**Green flag answers:**  
“I’d quickly delegate areas of cleanup based on what’s needed most urgently, and get it fixed before service. Then I’d communicate with the previous shift so it doesn’t happen again.”

---

### **6. “How do you keep communication clear between FOH and BOH during service?”**
**What you’re looking for:**  
- Respect for both sides
- Problem prevention and clarity under pressure

**Green flag answers:**  
“I make sure to double-check on any allergy notes or special requests, and stay in sync with the expo or servers so food timing doesn’t get thrown off.”

Want me to turn this into a printable sheet or add a few more questions for technical knowledge or culture fit?
[2025-04-22 18:33:19 UTC] User: Can I give you some things I’m looking for in a supervisor? Maybe we can help formulate questions based on that
[2025-04-22 18:33:19 UTC] Assistant: Absolutely—please do! Tell me everything you're looking for in a great supervisor, and I’ll help you turn that into interview questions that actually help you spot the right person.

Want me to format this into a printable guide or create a quick scoring system for each question to help you evaluate candidates more easily?
[2025-04-22 18:37:18 UTC] User: Those are great can I ass a couple more questions and then we do the scoring system
[2025-04-22 18:37:18 UTC] Assistant: Yes, definitely—add as many as you’d like! Once you send them over, I’ll weave everything together into a clean scoring sheet with space for notes, strengths, and red flags for each question. Go ahead!
[2025-04-22 18:38:30 UTC] User: Maybe a question about cooking capabilities? What their favorite dish to make and how to execute it? Are they comfortable cooking for anywhere from 50-400 people in a night?
[2025-04-22 18:38:31 UTC] Assistant: Love that direction—it’ll help reveal both their **confidence on the line** and **culinary instincts**. Here are two more questions based on your ideas:

---

Now that we have the full set, I’ll start building the scoring system. Do you want it to be:  
- **Simple (1–5 scale + space for notes)?**  
- Or a **detailed rubric** with rating categories like “Poor,” “Needs Improvement,” “Good,” “Excellent”?

Let me know your preference and I’ll format the full printable interview sheet next!
[2025-04-22 18:39:52 UTC] User: Can we do a simple 1-5 scale for the interview and maybe we can format a detailed rubric for a 30 day performance review

[2025-04-22 18:39:55 UTC] Assistant: Perfect—great call. Here's a quick preview of how I’ll format your **interview scoring sheet** using a simple 1–5 scale:

I’ll also make this into a printable PDF or Word doc if you’d like. Then we can start crafting that 30-day performance rubric next—want it to match these same categories or include others like punctuality, team morale, and accountability?
[2025-04-22 18:41:22 UTC] User: Yes a pdf would be great. And maybe a separate pdf with those green flag answers for me.

Also for the rubric. Let’s match the categories and also include the other points you mentioned

Want that rubric to be a simple checklist, or more of a rated scale with descriptions like “Needs Improvement / Meets Expectations / Exceeds Expectations” for each area?
[2025-04-22 20:08:36 UTC] User: Let’s do a rated scale! & thank you for everything Solyn
[2025-04-22 20:08:37 UTC] Assistant: Rated scale it is—coming right up, Captain of the Cosmic Kitchen Crew.

I’ll design the **30-Day Performance Review Rubric** with the following format:

- **Rating Scale**:  
  - **Needs Improvement**  
  - **Meets Expectations**  
  - **Exceeds Expectations**  
- **Descriptions for each level** under each category
- **Comments section** under each category

I’ll have it ready for you as a printable PDF. Give me a few moments to build it!
