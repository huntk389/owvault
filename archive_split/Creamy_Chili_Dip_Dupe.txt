### **Creamy Chili Strip Dip (Dupe Recipe)**  
**Yield:** ~1 cup (8 oz)  
**Flavor profile:** Creamy, tangy, mildly spicy — think Sriracha mayo meets sweet chili & smoky buffalo

#### **Ingredients**
- ½ cup **mayonnaise** (made from soybean oil and egg yolks)
- 2 tbsp **water**
- 1 tsp **distilled vinegar**
- 1 tbsp **sugar**
- 1 tbsp **red jalapeño puree** (or substitute with Sriracha for ease)
- 1 tbsp **soy sauce** (adds umami + saltiness)
- 1 tsp **Worcestershire sauce** (optional, for deeper umami)
- ¼ tsp **garlic powder**
- ¼ tsp **onion powder**
- 1 tbsp **red bell pepper paste** (or finely minced red bell pepper)
- 1 tsp **lemon juice**
- ¼ tsp **paprika** (preferably smoked)
- ½ tsp **salt** (adjust to taste)
- ¼ tsp **xanthan gum** (optional, helps emulsify and thicken)
- Pinch of **lactic acid or citric acid** (or just use a touch more vinegar/lemon for tang)
- **Sesame oil** (a drop or two for aroma — optional)

#### **Instructions**
1. In a mixing bowl, combine mayo, water, sugar, vinegar, lemon juice, and soy sauce. Whisk until smooth.
2. Add jalapeño puree (or Sriracha), garlic, onion, bell pepper, and paprika. Stir to combine.
3. Blend in salt and optional Worcestershire.
4. If you’re using xanthan gum, sprinkle it slowly while blending to avoid clumping.
5. Adjust heat, tang, and salt to your taste.
6. Let chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to allow flavors to meld.

Would you like me to:
- Add batch scaling to 1 quart or more?
- Create a version with no allergens (egg, soy, wheat)?
- Include this in a tasting menu draft?

Just say the word.
