A **scrum** can mean a couple different things depending on the context, but here are the two most common:

---

### 1. **In Agile Project Management (most common in work settings):**

A **Scrum** is a **framework for managing work**, especially in software or product development, but it’s also used in kitchens, event planning, and other team-based workflows.

- It’s part of the **Agile** methodology.
- Work is broken into small, time-boxed chunks called **sprints** (usually 1–2 weeks).
- Teams hold **daily stand-up meetings** (called “scrums”) to check in:
  - What did I do yesterday?
  - What will I do today?
  - What blockers are in my way?

Roles in a Scrum framework:
- **Product Owner** – sets priorities
- **Scrum Master** – makes sure the team follows the process, removes obstacles
- **Team Members** – the people doing the work

---

### 2. **In Rugby (the original meaning):**

A **scrum** is a formation where players pack closely together and push against the other team to try to gain possession of the ball.

---

If someone at work or a meeting said, “Let’s do a scrum,” they usually mean a **quick check-in meeting** where the team gets aligned on what everyone is doing and what’s in their way.
