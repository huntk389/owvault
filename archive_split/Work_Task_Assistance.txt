[2025-06-16 19:46:32 UTC] User: I have a work task I might need help on for the branch, can I send you the email from corporate?
[2025-06-16 19:46:31 UTC] Assistant: Of course, Kayla — send me the email and I’ll help you break it down, prioritize it, or draft any responses or deliverables you need for The Branch. Just copy and paste the email text here (or upload a screenshot if that’s easier), and I’ve got you.
[2025-06-16 19:46:50 UTC] User: Good Morning,
 
Now that the season is underway, we have started to see some great success in food and beverage. In an effort to keep this momentum, we would like to see all pre-shifts include a call out to being salespeople vs. order takers. In our concession style operations, we should be identifying upsell opportunities and making sure our teams have those items available to grab quickly for our guests. We should also be identifying opportunities to merchandise impulse buys for our guests near the POS. For our casual dine locations we should be making every effort to upsell desserts, appetizers, a second cocktail. Our team would like to help you all achieve these results. We would like to do a sales contest for each property. Please reply to Dawn Aparicio what you would like the contest at your property to entail and the criteria by end of day Friday. 
 
Thank you all for everything you do for our guests and teams every day,
 
Brian Sterner
Vice President, Parks and Resorts – Food & Beverage

- 2 points for every second cocktail sold  
- Bonus: 5 points for hitting a $100+ check total

Managers and supervisors will track upsell items during each shift via a tally sheet attached to the shift report. We'll spotlight top servers during pre-shift and share weekly rankings.

Would you like me to help design the tally sheet too?
[2025-06-16 19:50:37 UTC] User: Ooo I like it but we don’t have branch merch & I already know a pto shift won’t work. We have mostly seasonal employees & not everyone has a car either so it can’t be like a getaway unless maybe it’s like a tour in the park or something. 

They will do gift cards, maybe idk though. & we give out shift meals
[2025-06-16 19:50:37 UTC] Assistant: Perfect notes, Kayla — here’s a cleaner version of the proposal with **realistic, fun, and motivating prizes** for your seasonal crew at The Branch. I kept the structure strong for corporate but made the incentives feel more local and achievable:

Hi Dawn,

Thanks for launching this initiative — we’re excited to keep the momentum going at The Branch! Here’s our proposal for the summer sales contest:

---

**🎯 Contest Name:**  
**“Branch Out Your Sales” – Summer Upsell Showdown**

**🧾 Criteria:**  
- 1 point = each dessert sold  
- 1 point = each appetizer sold  
- 2 points = each second cocktail or mocktail sold  
- 🎉 Bonus: 5 points for any single guest check over $100  

**📊 Tracking:**  
Supervisors will tally upsell items per server each shift and post a running leaderboard in the BOH. We’ll spotlight top performers during pre-shift meetings to keep energy high.

**🏆 Weekly Incentives (Rotating):**  
- $25 Visa or local gift card (coffee shop, grocery, etc.)  
- Free entrée and dessert on their next shift meal  
- Optional: Guided Yellowstone tour voucher (if we can source through local partners)

**🎉 Grand Prize (End of Month):**  
- $100 Visa gift card or custom prize based on employee’s request (budget approved)  
- Feature in our team newsletter + brag board

Let me know if you'd like any adjustments — we’re ready to roll this out as early as next week!

Best,  
Kayla Hunt  
Kitchen Manager – The Branch  
West Yellowstone

Want me to draft the **tally sheet template** next? Or help brainstorm how to source that tour voucher from a local partner or DNC tour rep?
[2025-06-16 19:52:00 UTC] User: We have a tour guide service in town that our corporate owns, I just don’t feel like free food from where we work is a good incentive. Maybe like a small bonus or something
[2025-06-16 19:52:00 UTC] Assistant: Totally agreed — free food *where you already work* doesn’t exactly spark motivation. Let’s level up the reward structure to feel more exciting, while keeping it seasonal-employee friendly and realistic for corporate.

If your corporate owns a local **tour guide service**, that’s gold — we can frame that as a unique local perk, *only available to staff* through this contest.

Want me to whip up a branded tally sheet and leaderboard poster next?
[2025-06-16 19:53:51 UTC] User: Like how about maybe a percentage back on sales added to their check if they reach a certain profit margin
[2025-06-16 19:53:51 UTC] Assistant: Yes — now *that’s* a motivating, pro-level incentive. A **commission-style bonus** tied to actual upsells shows you're serious about rewarding effort and drives real results. Here's how we can frame it to stay clean for corporate and easy to track:
