[2025-06-25 20:46:37 UTC] Assistant: Of course they did — *"lentil loaf"* sounds like it belongs in a 1970s co-op cookbook, not on a modern menu. Let’s rebrand this thing.

Here are some **refined yet accessible** name options that keep the integrity of the dish but elevate the vibe:

### 🔥 Crowd-Pleasing Renames for “Lentil Loaf”:

1. **Savory Lentil Roast**
   - Familiar but elevated — feels intentional, not like a meatloaf knockoff.

2. **Herbed Lentil & Vegetable Terrine**
   - Fancy enough for a menu, still accurate if it’s loaf-shaped.

3. **Smoked Lentil Brick**
   - Earthy and masculine; great if the texture has that dense, hearty structure.

4. **Roasted Lentil Cake**
   - Surprisingly effective — “cake” in savory applications (like crab cake) has a much better ring than “loaf.”

5. **Spiced Lentil Roast with Caramelized Onion Glaze**
   - Descriptive, warm, and flavorful — lets the glaze take the spotlight.

6. **Baked Lentil Roulade** *(if there’s any swirl or layer effect)*  
7. **Heirloom Lentil Slab** *(if you want rustic and cheeky — only works with the right menu tone)*  
8. **Lentil Wellington** *(if wrapped in pastry or plated like one — people love this term)*  
9. **Seasonal Lentil Pressé** *(pressé implies it’s firmed and pressed — subtle French fancy)*  
10. **Golden Lentil Roast with Major Grey’s Chutney Glaze**  
   - If you’re pairing it with that chutney like we talked about — this sells.
