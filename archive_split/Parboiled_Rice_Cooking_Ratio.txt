Rice to water ratio
[2025-06-21 21:14:49 UTC] Assistant: For **parboiled white rice**, the typical **rice-to-water ratio** for cooking **1 cup of cooked rice** is:

### ✅ **1 part rice to 2 parts water**

But since you’re starting with **uncooked rice** and only need **1 cup cooked**, here’s the breakdown:

- **1/3 cup uncooked parboiled rice** = about **1 cup cooked rice**
- So use:  
  🔹 **1/3 cup rice**  
  🔹 **2/3 cup water**

### Cooking Tip:
- Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for ~20 minutes.
- Let it sit (covered) for 5 minutes off heat before fluffing.

Let me know if you’re batch scaling or adjusting for a buffet — I can do that quick too!
