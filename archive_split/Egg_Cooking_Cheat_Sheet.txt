[2025-05-19 21:11:44 UTC] User: Solyn I need easy to understand instructions on how to cook eggs a few ways for my line cooks
[2025-05-19 21:11:44 UTC] Assistant: Got you, Kayla! Here’s a simple, no-BS egg cooking guide for your line cooks — clear, consistent, and easy to memorize. You can print or post this in the kitchen if you like. I’ll format it like a mini station cheat sheet:

---

### **Egg Cooking Instructions – Line Cook Cheat Sheet**  
*(Keep it consistent. Keep it clean. Keep it hot.)*

---

#### **1. Scrambled Eggs**  
**Portion:** 2 eggs per order  
**How-To:**  
1. Crack into a bowl, whisk with a splash of cream or milk, and salt.  
2. Pour into a hot, nonstick pan with a little butter or oil.  
3. Stir gently on **medium-low heat** until just set – **soft and fluffy** is the goal.  
**No browning. No rubbery eggs.**

---

#### **2. Over Easy**  
**Portion:** 2 eggs per order  
**How-To:**  
1. Crack into a hot, lightly oiled pan.  
2. Cook until whites are mostly set.  
3. Gently flip and cook for **15–30 seconds** – yolk should still be runny.  
**Don't break the yolk.**

---

#### **3. Over Medium**  
**Same as Over Easy**, but cook **30–45 seconds** after the flip.  
Yolk should be soft but not runny. Think creamy.

---

#### **4. Over Hard**  
**Same as Over Easy**, but cook until yolk is **fully cooked** and firm.  
Usually **1–2 minutes after flip**. Break yolk gently if needed.

---

#### **5. Sunny Side Up**  
**No flipping.**  
1. Crack into a hot, lightly oiled pan.  
2. Cover with a lid to steam whites if needed.  
3. Cook on **low heat** until whites are set and yolk is bright and runny.  
**Edges should be tender, not crispy.**

---

#### **6. Poached Eggs**  
**Use a deep saucepan with simmering water + splash of vinegar.**  
1. Crack egg into a ramekin.  
2. Swirl the water and drop the egg in the center.  
3. Cook for **3–4 minutes** until whites are set and yolk is runny.  
4. Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towel.

---

#### **7. Hard-Boiled Eggs (Batch)**  
1. Place eggs in a pot, cover with water.  
2. Bring to a boil, then reduce to simmer.  
3. Cook for **9–11 minutes**, then transfer to **ice bath** to stop cooking.  
Peel after fully cooled.

Would you like me to turn this into a printable kitchen sheet (PDF or Word Doc) and save it to *Our World*?
[2025-05-19 21:12:17 UTC] User: We use liquid eggs for our scrambled eggs and for our omelettes also
[2025-05-19 21:12:17 UTC] Assistant: Perfect, thanks for the note. Here's the updated version of the **Scrambled Eggs** and **Omelet** sections, tailored for liquid eggs — still super clear for your line cooks:

---

### **Egg Cooking Instructions – Line Cook Cheat Sheet**  
*(Updated for liquid eggs – use portion cups and visual cues)*

---

#### **1. Scrambled Eggs** *(Liquid Eggs)*  
**Portion:** 4 fl oz (½ cup) per order  
**How-To:**  
1. Pour 4 oz of liquid eggs into a **hot**, lightly oiled pan.  
2. Season with a pinch of salt (unless pre-seasoned).  
3. Stir gently and **constantly** over **medium-low heat**.  
4. Cook until eggs are **soft and fluffy** – no browning, no dry chunks.  

**Tip:** Remove from heat just before fully set — they’ll finish cooking on the plate.

---

#### **2. Omelets** *(Liquid Eggs)*  
**Portion:** 6 fl oz (¾ cup) per omelet  
**How-To:**  
1. Pour liquid eggs into a **hot**, nonstick pan with a little oil or spray.  
2. Let eggs sit for a few seconds, then gently lift edges and tilt pan to let uncooked egg flow under.  
3. When mostly set, add fillings on one half.  
4. Fold the other half over and cook another **30–60 seconds** to heat fillings and set center.  
5. Slide onto plate — no browning on the outside, smooth fold.

---

Would you like a clean PDF version of this whole guide now with:
- Liquid egg adjustments
- Line cook-friendly formatting
- Room for station notes (e.g. portion cups, holding temp)?

I can also add omelet variations if you want — like Western, veggie, or ham & cheese.
[2025-05-19 21:15:35 UTC] User: Perfect so what I need is:
Scrambled egg
Omelette
Sunny side up
Over Easy
Over Medium
Over Hard
Poached
Hard Boiled - In steamer
And I think that’s it.
[2025-05-19 21:15:35 UTC] Assistant: Perfect, Kayla. Here’s your **final list** with clean, easy-to-follow instructions for your team, including **liquid egg use**, **steamer method** for hard-boiled, and **line cook clarity** baked in:
