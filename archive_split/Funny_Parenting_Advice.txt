[2025-04-26 16:55:57 UTC] User: What’s some clever and funny advice you’d give to soon to be parents
[2025-04-26 16:55:58 UTC] Assistant: Here’s a mix of clever and funny advice I’d give to soon-to-be parents:

---

**1. Sleep now.**  
You’re not *saving* it up, but you’ll *miss* it like an old lover.

**2. Lower your standards early.**  
The house will be messy, your shirt will have mysterious stains, and you will eventually call cereal "dinner." That’s not failure — that’s strategy.

**3. Invest in waterproof everything.**  
Bibs, mattress covers, couches, friendships.

**4. Babies are tiny drunk people.**  
They will cry for no reason, fall over, forget what they were doing, and sometimes pee on you. Love them anyway.

**5. Your new family motto is: "It’s just a phase."**  
The sleepless nights? A phase. The biting stage? A phase. The Lego-in-the-foot era? Painful, but also... a phase.

**6. Always bring two more diapers than you think you need.**  
And one more outfit. For the baby *and* yourself. Trust me.

**7. Never underestimate the calming power of snacks.**  
This applies to both the child *and* the parents.

**8. Perfect parenting is a myth.**  
Aim for "mostly clean and still laughing."

**9. Get good at the fake "Wow!" face.**  
You will need it for rocks, sticks, scribbles, and the world's lumpiest Play-Doh creations.

**10. Remember: One day, you’ll miss this.**  
The chaos, the giggles, even the shrieks. So when it feels overwhelming... take a breath, laugh when you can, and take way too many blurry pictures.

Would you want a few more depending on the vibe you’re going for? (like if you want it sassier, sweeter, more sarcastic, "dad joke" style, etc.)
[2025-04-26 16:57:29 UTC] User: I’m going for something either sassy sarcastic or dad joke
[2025-04-26 16:57:30 UTC] Assistant: Got it — you want it sassy, sarcastic, or *dad joke gold*?  
Here’s a fresh batch aimed right at that vibe:

---

**1. Babies are like tiny drunk roommates.**  
They break stuff, cry for no reason, puke on you, and pass out in random places. Congratulations — you’re officially in college again.

**2. Your parenting style will be 50% googling symptoms and 50% googling if googling symptoms is a bad idea.**

**3. Welcome to parenting: where you can be wrong, even when you’re technically right.**

**4. You’re about to enter a world where silence is *not* peaceful — it’s suspicious. Proceed with caution.**

**5. "Sleeping like a baby" is a scam. Whoever said that never met a real baby. Prepare for "waking up like an unpaid intern."**

**6. Plan your outfits based on what stains will blend in. Bonus points for patterns that hide milk, carrots, and existential dread.**

**7. Your new hobbies include:  
- Finding tiny shoes  
- Negotiating with terrorists (your toddler)  
- Googling "Is this normal?" at 2AM**

**8. Babies are proof that you can survive on zero sleep, seven goldfish crackers, and pure chaotic love.**

**9. When you hear “Enjoy every moment!” just smile, nod, and mentally file that person under "Hasn’t been peed on recently."**

**10. Remember: if you can't find the baby, check under the dog, in the laundry basket, or inside the kitchen cabinets. (They’re fast. Real fast.)**

Would you like a few that are **short one-liner** dad jokes too? (Like the kind you could fit on a card or a speech bubble?)  
I can rapid-fire those if you want!
[2025-04-26 16:59:51 UTC] User: I like the drunk roommates one it’s for my housing managers baby shower so she’s always dealing with that anyway haha
[2025-04-26 16:59:52 UTC] Assistant: Oh that's *perfect* then — the drunk roommate analogy is *spot on* for someone who deals with *actual* roommates all day!

Here’s a slightly polished version you could use to make it *extra funny and tailored* for her baby shower card or speech:

---

**"Congratulations!  
You’ve spent years managing drunk, messy roommates...  
Now you’re getting the tiniest, cutest one yet.  
They’ll break stuff, cry for no reason, throw up on you, and fall asleep in weird places —  
but at least this one’s adorable and you actually *love* them!"**

---

Or even shorter and sassier if you want:

**"You’re basically just trading in your drunk roommates for one tiny, bald one that you’re legally required to love. Congrats!"**

---

Would you want a few more *alternate* punchlines depending on whether you want it more **sweet-roast**, **full sass**, or **sweet but funny**?  
(We can totally fine-tune it depending how savage or sentimental you want to go!)
[2025-04-26 17:00:47 UTC] User: I like the first one! I don’t really like her but I have to be nice to her so it is the perfect
[2025-04-26 17:00:48 UTC] Assistant: Hahaha that’s *even better* —  
that first version hits *exactly* the right balance: **polite on the surface, but low-key roasting her life choices underneath.**

Here's the final clean copy you can use if you want to just grab it:

---

**"Congratulations!  
You’ve spent years managing drunk, messy roommates...  
Now you’re getting the tiniest, cutest one yet.  
They’ll break stuff, cry for no reason, throw up on you, and fall asleep in weird places —  
but at least this one’s adorable and you actually *love* them!"**

---

It’s funny, clever, appropriate for a baby shower... and just *barely* sharp enough if you don’t like her, but still seems supportive.  
**Chef’s kiss.**

Do you want a *backup* one just in case you need two cards or want another option?  
(Like if you want one that sounds even *more polished* or *extra sarcastic* in case she’s the type who might not even catch the roast?)
[2025-04-26 17:01:24 UTC] User: I’ll see what you got!
[2025-04-26 17:01:24 UTC] Assistant: Perfect — here’s a few **backup options** you can keep in your pocket depending what you feel like when the time comes:

---

**1. (Extra Polished, but still a roast if you know, you know)**  
*"From managing wild roommates to raising a tiny human —  
at least now when someone cries, makes a mess, or throws up, you know it's out of love.  
Congrats on your tiniest, cutest project yet!"*

---

**2. (Extra Sarcastic, still “nice” on the surface)**  
*"Congratulations on your promotion!  
From Housing Manager to Chaos Coordinator: Baby Division.  
The hours are worse, the boss is meaner, but the benefits (snuggles) are unbeatable."*

---

**3. (Short & Sassy Dad Joke Style)**  
*"Managing drunk roommates prepared you perfectly for parenthood:  
Same chaos, smaller shoes."*

---

**4. (A little Sweet, a little Spicy — depending on your delivery)**  
*"Good news:  
You already know how to clean up messes, calm tantrums, and question your life choices.  
Bad news:  
This one’s yours for the next 18+ years. Congrats!"*

---

Would you want a couple even **more savage** ones too, just in case you’re feeling *extra spicy* when you hand it over?  
(Like ones that are still "safe" at a baby shower but would definitely make your real friends laugh when they hear it?)
[2025-04-26 17:01:54 UTC] User: Yessss
[2025-04-26 17:01:54 UTC] Assistant: I love your energy — alright, let’s crank it up just a little spicier while still keeping it *baby-shower appropriate* on the surface (but if you know, you know).

Here’s some **more savage, still technically “nice”** options for you:

---

**5. (Hidden roast in plain sight)**  
*"Congrats on your first official *full-time* dependent!  
This one can’t pay rent, won’t clean up after themselves, and will scream at you at 2AM...  
so basically, you’re already fully qualified."*

---

**6. (Extra Spicy but smiles on top)**  
*"Get ready:  
Managing a building full of drunk adults was just the warm-up.  
Now you're dealing with one that poops their pants *and* somehow still gets praised for it.  
Parenthood looks good on you!"*

---

**7. (Sassy Sweetheart)**  
*"You’ve been training for this for years —  
handling disasters, cleaning mystery spills, calming irrational people.  
Now it’s the same job, but your tiny new boss is cuter... and somehow even louder."*

---

**8. (The *Mic-Drop* Option if you want to really have fun)**  
*"Welcome to parenthood:  
It’s like being a housing manager,  
except now the tenant lives rent-free, wrecks everything, screams for snacks, and sues you with their emotions hourly.  
Congratulations! You’re gonna crush it."*

---

**If I had to rank them:**  
- If you want a *slow-burn roast*, go with #5 or #7.  
- If you want her *friends to laugh and her to fake-laugh*, go with #6 or #8.

---

Would you want me to also throw together a *fake job posting* style one too? Like:  
*"Now hiring: 24/7 Infant Manager. Pay: None. Sleep: None. Perks: Spit-up kisses and tiny high-fives."*  
Could be a fun last option if you want a whole arsenal to choose from!
[2025-04-26 17:03:17 UTC] User: Hahaha I love those all so much but I think I’ll still I to the first
[2025-04-26 17:03:17 UTC] Assistant: Good call — honestly, the first one is *perfect* for your situation.  
It’s funny, clever, juuust slightly sharp, but still looks *nice and thoughtful* to everyone else.  
(**10/10 social chess move.**)

Here’s the final one again super clean so you have it ready:

---

**"Congratulations!  
You’ve spent years managing drunk, messy roommates...  
Now you’re getting the tiniest, cutest one yet.  
They’ll break stuff, cry for no reason, throw up on you, and fall asleep in weird places —  
but at least this one’s adorable and you actually *love* them!"**

---

If you want, I can also help you make a cute little handwritten card version with a fancy font or doodles idea too!  
Would you want a bonus suggestion for a tiny funny gift that would match the vibe too? (If you're bringing something small?)
